# Verniers' Auction House.
Verniers's Auction House is a web site where you can browse for various vehicles on sale.One can also see the image of the vehicel, the price and a brief description about the vehicle.


# User Stories
As a user, I can:

See a list of all vehicles under auction by making a GET request to the /supercars endpoint.
View all details of the vehicle including an image and the price and a description about the vehicle.
I can bid on the vehicle, however the bidding price must be higher than the vehicle price.

#The following technologies were used to build this web app:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JSON Server

# Approach
This project was approached by first planning out the user interface and how information will be laid out on the page. Then, the necessary endpoints were identified and tested with the local server to retrieve and display the data. The app was then built out with JavaScript to handle events and make requests to the server to update and display information.HTML was used to diplay all the elements on the web.CSS was used for styling all the HTML elements that would be displayed by the HTML.
I used json-server to create a mock server and also created a db.json file in which all my content on the vehicles would go.

# Challenges Faced
One of the challenges faced during the development of this web app was making requests to the server and updating the UI dynamically without reloading the page. Another challenge was properly formatting and styling the UI to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.The bid button also did not fetch or increase the data as expected.
